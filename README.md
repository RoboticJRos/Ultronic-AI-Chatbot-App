# Ultronic AI Chatbot App

## Overview
This is my senior development project: a custom AI chatbot that troubleshoots and analyzes code in multiple programming languages including Python, Java, Arduino IDE, and PLC (Programmable Logic Controller) programming. This represents a professional-level undertaking that has significantly enhanced my skills in AI development.

## Project Details
- **Course:** CSE 499 - Senior Capstone Project
- **Institution:** Brigham Young University - Idaho
- **Semester:** Spring 2025
- **Developer:** Johnny Ros

## Features
- **Multi-Language Support:** Analyze and troubleshoot code in Python, Java, Arduino IDE, and PLC programming
- **File Upload Capability:** Upload code files directly for analysis
- **Interactive Chat Interface:** Engage with Ultronic AI for real-time code assistance
- **Safety-First Design:** Built-in safety interlocks and error handling
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Clean, intuitive Streamlit-based web application

## Supported File Types
- **Python:** `.py`, `.ipynb`
- **Java:** `.java`, `.jar`, `.class`
- **Arduino:** `.ino`, `.c`, `.cpp`, `.h`
- **PLC:** `.rsl`, `.acd`, `.rss`, `.l5x`, `.pro`, `.s7p`, `.cxp`, and other common PLC formats
- **General:** `.txt`, `.md`, `.json`, `.xml`, `.log`

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend:** Streamlit
- **AI Model:** OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Deployment:** Streamlit Community Cloud

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository
2. Install required dependencies: `pip install streamlit openai`
3. Set up your OpenAI API key in `.streamlit/secrets.toml`
4. Run the application: `streamlit run SPAIappSLSF.py`

## Usage
1. **Upload a Code File:** Drag and drop or browse for your code file
2. **Ask Questions:** Type your questions about the code or request troubleshooting help
3. **Get Analysis:** Ultronic AI will analyze your code and provide feedback
4. **Iterate:** Continue the conversation to refine your code

## Project Status
ðŸš§ **Currently in Development** - This project is actively being developed as part of my senior capstone course. I am carefully studying this proprietary developer platform before continuing to collaborate and move forward with development.

## Future Enhancements
- Support for additional programming languages
- Enhanced code analysis capabilities
- Integration with more PLC platforms
- Advanced debugging features
